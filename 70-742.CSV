In some situations, this may not be acceptable. In order to specify a cluster that is allowed to issue use licenses for content protected by a different cluster, the first cluster must be defined as a trusted publishing domain. If content was published by another certification cluster either in your organization, for example, a subsidiary organization in another forest, or in a separate organization, your AD RMS cluster can grant use licenses to users for this content by configuring a Trusted Publishing Domain on your AD RMS cluster. By adding a Trusted Publishing Domain, you set up a trust relationship between your AD RMS cluster and the other certification cluster by importing the Trusted Publishing Certificate of the other cluster. </p>;A;;;;1.0;;;
