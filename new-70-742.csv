Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. The forest contains an Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) deployment. Your company establishes a partnership with another company named Fabrikam, Inc. The network of Fabrikam contains an Active Directory forest named fabrikam.com and an AD RMS deployment. You need to ensure that the users in contoso.com can access rights protected documents sent by the users in fabrikam.com. Solution: From AD RMS in contoso.com, you configure fabrikam.com as a trusted publisher domain. Does this meet the goal?;Explanation/Reference: Explanation: By default, an AD RMS Licensing Server can issue use licenses for only content where it originally issued the publishing license. In some situations, this may not be acceptable. In order to specify a cluster that is allowed to issue use licenses for content protected by a different cluster, the first cluster must be defined as a trusted publishing domain. If content was published by another certification cluster either in your organization, for example, a subsidiary organization in another forest, or in a separate organization, your AD RMS cluster can grant use licenses to users for this content by configuring a Trusted Publishing Domain on your AD RMS cluster. By adding a Trusted Publishing Domain, you set up a trust relationship between your AD RMS cluster and the other certification cluster by importing the Trusted Publishing Certificate of the other cluster.
